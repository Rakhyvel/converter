# This right here is a header
This is a paragraph. It can contain *italic* text, **bold** text, and `inline code`.
```
This is a code-block
    Text in here SHOULD 
        be 
        formatted
    correctly

const sys = import "<std/sys.orng>"
const main:(args:[]String)->!() = 
    sys.println("Hello, world!")
```
## This is another smaller header
Here's another paragraph. Just testing things work...
