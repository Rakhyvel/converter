# Goal
The goal of this project is to explore and compare/constrast general purpose languages. The same Markdown to HTML converter is implemented in each language. Each language has a comment with the command to run the program, as well as my opinions about the language as I was implementing the converter.

# Ground rules
- Only declare types when necessary
- Write idomatic code for the language
- Only use the standard library that comes with the language
    - (exception: can use libc for assembly)
